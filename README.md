# PA3
Design Thinking Final Passion Project

# Idea 1

## Empathize:
- A 20 year old is struggling to save money, they spend a lot in one day and do not realize how much they spent until they look at their card budget at the end of day. This behavior continues for some time.
## Research:
- In person interview with my dad (his experience when he struggled to save money)
## Define:
- HMW...help individuals save money?
- HMW...help individuals be aware of how much they spend at one time?
- HMW...create better ways to limit expenses?
    - ex. if >50: consider what you are spending it on and if it was really important
    - ex. if >100: maybe try not to spend money for the next 2 weeks or so
## Idea:
- Budget Planner

# Idea 2

## Empathize:
- A 25 year old who is struggling to eat healthier. They often lack benefical nutritional values such as proteins and carbs and eat excessive amounts of foods high in saturated and trans fat, cholestrol, and sodium.
## Research:
- Research blogs and get a better understanding of why people struggle to eat healthier
## Define:
- HMW...help individuals who might have a underlying condition due to not being able to eat healthier?
- HMW...help people find recipies that they will enjoy as well as gain benefical nutrition out of it?
- HMW...help different individuals satisfy their own needs?
## Idea:
- Recipie Planner




# Idea Chosen

## Idea 1 - Budget Planner

### Empathize (again)
- A 20 year old is struggling to save money, they spend a lot in one day and do not realize how much they spent until they look at their card budget at the end of day. This behavior continues for some time

### Research
- My dad said: *"People lack information about investments, and how important it is to start investing. They start spending money that doesn't add value or is not the right investment, they usually spend more to show off to other people. They go in the trap of loans, buying jewerly, vacations, clubs, and cars. They spend tons of money in these categories and tend to spend more than they make. It gives them a short time of pleasure."*

- Article: https://www.pnc.com/insights/personal-finance/save/why-cant-i-save-money.html
    - People struggle to save money because: *high expenses, lack of budgeting, unclear goals, reliance on credit cards, and burdens like student loans.* 
    - Successful  saving requires identifying these barriers and building better financial habits such as creating a budget and cutting unnecessary costs

## Ideas for this budget planner
- Show different categories that users can pick from
- Display limits that each category has
- Allow users to type in their expense for each category
- Give a choice for the users to be able to type a little note on why they made that expense.

## Description on how it works
- Okay so, users will be able to type in their expenses in different categories and even modify limits to their liking. They will also be able to type a short note inside on why they spent money that category to make them feel more aware of what they are spending it on. If the user goes over the limit it will print a statement: "Over Budget!" 
- At the end, their expenses will be totaled.

## Reflection
### WWW
- I liked how I learnt new things such as the date function in python and how to do the parts thing with the len function. I also learnt the new function startwith() that made it easier for python to read what the user has inputted
- I like how I was able to get it so the user is able to change the limits incase it was not up to their liking
- I liked how I was able to incorporate what I've learnt from the other two PA's before this into my PA3
- I liked the part where I added a note I thought that was a good way to make people feel more aware of what they are spending their money on
### EBI
- I think I could've changed the formatting a little bit because two people who I peer-reviewed with, Isis and Minal, said the formatting was a bit compact and it was hard to follow
- Maybe it would be better if I had been more explicit with the instructions so people wouldn't be confused
- I also found out that people could type negative numbers and it would still work (Sunny typed -10 and it still let her pass through but I don't think you can have a negative expense) so maybe if I expand on this I would make it so you can't type negative numbers 
### IMT
- If I had more time I would definitely create a function where everyone can play this because right now it can only be played by one person and after that one person stops playing I have delete all contents from the txt file
- If I had more time i'd make sure that theres a way to save the limits as well for next time and not only the expenses because the limits always reset after playing again
- I would add more categories or let users type their own categories because I think spendings obviously aren't limited to those 14 categories.
- Also I know for the flowchart, I only created it for the main function and not the other functions because I didn't have much time to do it
